A customer forgets directions to the parking lot, and ends up on the other side of the road. The customer is not skilled enough to cross a busy multi-lane road with moving cars, where the speed of cars can differ across lanes, but cars in the same lane move with the same speed. To reach the entrance of the parking lot (identified as goal state in the environment), he calls you up and asks you to drive the car from his spot (the initial state) to the destination. Unlike the previous task, the agentâ€™s speed range in the environment is restricted to [-3, -1].
